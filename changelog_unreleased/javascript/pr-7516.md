#### Put space after generator star, not before ([#7516](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/7516) by [@bakkot](https://github.com/bakkot))

This is a partial revert of [PR 3903](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/3903/), which included an unrelated change to the spacing of the `*` used for generator declarations and `yield*`. This PR reverts to the previous formatting, such that `function*` and `yield*` are treated as whole words, rather than treating `*` as a prefix operator.

```js
// Input
function * getRawText() {
  for (const token of tokens) {
    yield * token.getRawText();
  }
}
// Prettier stable
function *getRawText() {
  for (const token of tokens) {
    yield *token.getRawText();
  }
}
// Prettier master
function* getRawText() {
  for (const token of tokens) {
    yield* token.getRawText();
  }
}
```
